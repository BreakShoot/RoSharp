# RoSharp

An unofficial and disastorously experimental attempt to create a Lua Environment in a purely external C# application.


## Warnings and Disclaimers
  - This is a completely unsupported and open-source attempt. Currently this semi-works for 1/10/2020.
  - There is no working retcheck bypass, I am attempting to configure this in but the lua environment does actually work.

## Why is this a thing?
A lot of people believe you can only achieve a lua environment in C++ internal applications, but this is living proof you absolutely can
do it externally in C#.

## What are the goals for this project?
  - Eventually release a library for people to create and call Lua functions on the fly
  - Create a working retcheck bypass (urgent)
  - Provide affective documentation
